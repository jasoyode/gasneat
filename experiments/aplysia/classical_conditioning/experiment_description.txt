Perhaps surprisingly, classical conditioning can be observed in the gill-withdrawal 
reflex of sea slugs. In the “training” process, a weak touch to the siphon (CS) is 
followed immediately by a sharp blow to the tail or head (US), which, of course, 
evokes a marked gill-withdrawal response (see Figure 21-52). After a series of 
such trials, the gill-withdrawal response to the CS alone is substantially enhanced, 
as if the animal “learns” that a weak siphon touch (CS) is followed by a noxious, 
sharp blow (US). As in conditioning in other animals, the CS must precede the US by 
a short and definite interval, in this case 1 – 2 seconds.


pain needs to be tied to health for selection to be effective... i think
or it at least would be more useful...

pain is not just a signal, it must be tied to value in lvinig.dying somehow
